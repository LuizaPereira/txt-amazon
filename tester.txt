review/summary: Making the cut!
review/text: Looked all over in art supply and other stores for "crazy cutting" scissors for my 4-year old grandson. These are exactly what I was looking for - fun, very well made, metal rather than plastic blades (so they actually do a good job of cutting paper), safe ("blunt") ends, etc. (These really are for age 4 and up, not younger.) Very high quality. Very pleased with the product.

review/text: These are the BEST scissors I have ever owned. I am left-handed and take note that either a left or right-handed person can use these equally well.If you have arthritis, as I do, these scissors are amazing as well. Well worth the price. I now own three pairs of these and have convinced many other people in my quilting group that they NEED a pair as well!They cut through muli layers and difficult to cut items really well.Do buy them, you won't regret it!

review/summary: A great tool to make your work easier
review/text: I finally gave in and bought these after years of wanting them. I'm so glad I did!I'm a book artist and crafter, and I usually do my creative work in marathon stretches. (You know, nothing for three weeks and then an all-day session...) These scissors make it so much easier. They cut easily and cleanly, with no hand fatigue. They also saved me when I did all my Christmas gift wrapping.I should have just bought these in the first place!

review/text: This is my second pair of Fiskar multi-purpose scissors. I got the first pair 6 years ago and used them constantly in my art studio for all kinds of cutting. They worked perfectly until I accidentally stepped on them. These scissors are extremely comfortable, stay sharper than the traditional kind, and work beautifully.

review/text: I received only 1 canvas, even though it says it's a pack of 6. The 1 canvas I did get was great and I already painted on it. I had to chat w/ customer service and they advised they would resend me the order 1 day shipping, but then I looked at the delivery estimate and I won't get it until 9/18/12- 10/5/12, which is pointless. I just read all the other reviews and this seems to be a common occurrence.

review/summary: STILL only sending 1 instead of 6 pack, 2 year problem
review/text: I realize that this "should" be a review about the quality of the product, BUT for almost 2 YEARS people have been commenting that they received one canvas instead of a pack of six. Sorry, but that is simply unacceptable. I'm very disappointed in Amazon for letting it go on this long. I'm sorry that the manufacturer won't have people purchasing their item, but there is no excuse for a problem to continue for nearly 2 years and not be resolved.

review/text: Like one of the other reviewers, I ordered this as a pack of six. However, it arrived and it was a single canvas in a giant box. What happened to the other five? When I contacted Amazon, it says that they're out of stock for these. Why is this happening to more than one person? Just be sure to check your box. The canvas was nice and actually what I wanted but I didn't want to pay for six and get one...

review/text: I was having a painting party for my daughter's 12th birthday party and wanted the kids to have something nice to take home with them, but the cost of canvases can really add up!! I found these canvases for a great price and they were perfect for the purpose for which they were used. I'm not an artist myself, so I don't know much about the quality of canvases, but these definitely met our needs and the girls had a ball!

review/summary: Pretty Basic
review/text: The canvas is nice and heavy and the support is strong. Though I find it a bit heavy for the size of the canvas. It wasn't quite fully stretched and required a bit of work to keep it from bulging throughout the painting process. Required some priming (just basic gesso) before painting. I tried do paint without it at first and the canvas just soaked up my acrylics. Even texture throughout the canvas made it easier once the gesso had been put on. Overall, a pretty basic stretched canvas. Great for the price on all 6 at once though.
